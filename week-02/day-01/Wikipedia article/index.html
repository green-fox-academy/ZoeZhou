                    Margaret Heafield Hamilton (née Heafield; born August 17, 1936)[2] is an American computer scientist, systems engineer, and
                    business owner. She was Director of the Software Engineering Division[3] of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory,
                    which developed on-board flight software for the Apollo space program.[4] In 1986, she became the founder
                    and CEO of Hamilton Technologies, Inc., in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was developed around
                    the Universal Systems Language based on her paradigm of Development Before the Fact (DBTF) for systems
                    and software design.[5] Hamilton has published over 130 papers, proceedings, and reports about the 60
                    projects and six major programs in which she has been involved. On November 22, 2016, she was awarded
                    the Presidential Medal of Freedom by U.S. President Barack Obama for her work leading the development
                    of on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo Moon missions.[1][6]

                    Margaret Heafield was born in Paoli, Indiana, to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield (née Partington).[7] After graduating
                    from Hancock High School in 1954, she started out in mathematics at the University of Michigan in 1955
                    and subsequently earned a B.A. in mathematics with a minor in philosophy from Earlham College in 1958.[8][9]
                    She briefly taught high school mathematics and French upon graduation, in order to support her husband
                    while he worked on his undergraduate degree at Harvard, with the ultimate goal of pursuing a graduate
                    degree at a later time. She moved to Boston, Massachusetts, with the intention of doing graduate study
                    in abstract mathematics at Brandeis University. She cites a female math professor as helping her desire
                    to pursue abstract mathematics. She had other inspirations outside the technological world, including
                    her father, the philosopher and poet, and her grandfather, a school headmaster and Quaker Minister. She
                    says these men inspired her to a minor in philosophy.[10] In 1960 she took an interim position at MIT
                    to develop software for predicting weather on the LGP-30 and the PDP-1 computers (at Marvin Minsky's
                    Project MAC) for professor Edward Norton Lorenz in the meteorology department.[11][2][12] Hamilton wrote
                    that at that time, computer science and software engineering were not yet disciplines; instead, programmers
                    learned on the job with hands-on experience.[4] From 1961 to 1963, she worked on the SAGE Project at
                    Lincoln Lab, where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the first AN/FSQ-7 computer
                    (the XD-1), to search for "unfriendly" aircraft; she also wrote software for the Air Force Cambridge
                    Research Laboratories.
